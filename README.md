# Autogenerated Code

Some parts of this repo is auto generated.

* collector/components\* are autogenerated and modified to include the custom 
components defined under _gnmi_ and _gnmipath_.
* component/internal/* is autogenerated and unmodified.

## How to autogenerate

This is explained at length
[here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/) but here are
the commands that need to be run. *Note:* this assumes they have been installed
following the documentation above.

* To regenerate the `collector` subdir: `ocb --config builder-config.yaml`
* To regenerate the `internal` subdir in a component:
`mdatagen metadata.yaml`
